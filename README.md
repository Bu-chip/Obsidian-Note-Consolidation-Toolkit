# Obsidian-Note-Consolidation-Toolkit
The "Obsidian Note Consolidation Toolkit" is a custom Python script designed for users of the Obsidian note-taking application. It streamlines the process of compiling a main note and all its internally linked notes into a single, comprehensive document. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your computer. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Make sure you have a text editor, like Notepad or Visual Studio Code, to edit and run the script.

2. **Set Up the Script**:
   - Copy the script into a text editor.
   - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `note_consolidation_toolkit.py`.

3. **Edit the Script for Your Use**:
   - In the script, locate the lines where you need to enter the path of your main note and your Obsidian vault. These will be marked clearly in the code.
   - Replace the placeholders with the actual paths.

4. **Running the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the `cd` command.
   - Run the script by typing `python note_consolidation_toolkit.py`.

5. **Review the Output**:
   - The script will create a new note within your Obsidian vault. This note will contain the content of your main note followed by the contents of all linked notes.
   - Open Obsidian to review the consolidated note.

6. **Customize as Needed**:
   - You can modify the script to change how the notes are consolidated. For instance, you might want to add separators or titles for each linked note.

This toolkit serves a pivotal role in preparing notes for interaction with language models like ChatGPT. By consolidating multiple related notes into a single document, it facilitates the efficient transfer of organized information, enabling seamless integration and interaction with AI models. This feature was the primary motivation behind its creation, catering to users looking to leverage AI technology for enhanced note analysis and processing.
